I started this webpage with no prior knowledge on .Net or Blazor, but learning to use them was not a big deal. The hardest part of this project has been deploying it succesfully to github pages. It has been an ardous work to realize what was failling; just following the errors couldn't help me, until I found [THE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNxII6jvPvQ) video.

The main issue with github pages and Blazor applications is that:
1. Github modifies some files when deploying.
   --> In the root of the project, in the terminal, execute: ` "* binary" >> .attributes `
   The .attributes file will tell github to treat all files as binary files, so it will not modify them.
   
2. Github treats some files as jekyll files.
   --> In the root directory, create an empty file named .nojekyll
   This will prevent github to treat some autogenerated files as jekyll.

3. The routes are not the same when running on localhost or on github pages.
   --> In the <base> tag in index.html, change ("/") for ("/YourProjectName/")
   Github deploys your webpage on username.github.io/YourProjectName, so your root is this one insted.

The last setback I had was creating a workflow. Before this project I even didn't know about their existence. They are very powerfull, but as with anything, you need to know how to use them. I solved this by checking many people blazor projects to understand what was going on, and also watching many videos (finding the solution again in [THE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNxII6jvPvQ) same video as before. All in 16 minutes. The deal is to find it!

For creating a workflow, you need to automate the whole process of what you would do yourself: checkout the branch that contains the project, setup dotnet, install wasm tools, publish it and commit it to github pages using your token. In my case I finally added to the workflow the creation of the .nojekyll file and the 404 file and the routes thing, as in the video, but it's not needed to automate this.
